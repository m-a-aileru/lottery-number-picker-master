## [Title]

The world famous (in my mind) and ambitiously-named "Lottery Number Picker".

## [Overview]

This product was put together as an easy web app idea to get my dinky little web developer feet wet, and it pretty much speaks for itself. The "Lottery Number Picker" was built for the sole purpose of winning people millions on The National Lottery, and I don't even ask for a share (although, as long as you're buying, a cup of coffee would be nice). It more or less and without frills or fuss picks six random numbers between 1 and 49 for you so that you don't have to. How time-saving is that, eh?

## [Features]

Again, no frills or fuss but I didn't want it to be completely garish to look at, so it features award-winning worthy design (okay, it's a stretch, I admit), as well as:

- Six colourful digital balls to display six random numbers
- A 'draw' button to draw six random numbers (between 1 and 49) into aforementioned digital colourful digital balls for your viewing pleasure
- A colourful linear gradient background that's nice enough to not completely distract you from your random lotto ball-viewing needs

There might very well be more features coming soon so watch this space for updates.

## [Sections]

- App name (LOTTERY NUMBER PICKER) in case for some reason you forget what you're using
- Ball display area
- A number-drawing section (okay, it's just the 'draw' button, okay?)
